The app is mobile-ready, offline-storage, and written in ReactJS with TypeScript.

  - Fully supported CRUD operations.
  - DB independent - using file which contains all the data and can be edited.
  - Has pretty simple API calls.

### Tech

The application uses the following open source projects:

* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [TypeScript] - strict syntactical superset of JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Yarn] - package manager that doubles down as project manager.
* [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - Created with <3 for developers who need a quick API for prototyping and mocking.


### Installation
